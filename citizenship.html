    <h1>Citizenship</h1>
    <h2>Cute Puppy</h2>
      <p> Citizenship: When one properly fulfills his or her role as a citizen by getting educated to help citizens make good decisions and deal with demagogues who would delude them.<p>
      <p> I believe that honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage are all necessary components of good citizenship. Honesty is important because If nobody is honest with each other, then only lies and rumors are spread which will only cause chaos and unfairness in society. Compassion is important because it portrays a feeling of sympathy and the need to help. If everyone across the globe was willing to feel for others and give back to the community, then Earth would be a great place full of great citizens. This goes hand in hand with respect, if people respected others ideas, lifestyles, and citizenship, then this place would be much more enjoyable for everyone. Responsibility means being held for one's own actions no matter the situation. This a necessary component to being a good citizen because again it requires you to take care of yourself and others which is really the best quality a citizen can have. Lastly, courage requires taking risks and standing up for what you believe in which really shapes the country. If the people did not evoke their ideas, then we would not have a democracy which is what our government runs on. Therefore, all of these qualities are great and necessary components to being a good citizen.

      <p> I believe another important aspect of citizenship is open-mindedness. This is an imporant characteristic for one to have so that they are willing and excepting of others within the community. If one is to be a citizen, they must realize that the not everyone has the same beliefs, so being openminded and accepting of others around them is important to making the society function.
      <br/>
      <p> One act as a citizen that I performed was when I invited someone who was sitting alone to sit with me and my friends at lunch. I believe that this was an act of compassion and caring for others within my community by making that person feel that they were not alone and that they had someone to talk to.
