    <p>The north pole is a really cool place to tour and visit, and there are many cool attractions to go see! One being Santa's house (seen in the top left picture). He allows many tours and pictures from 10am-4pm on the weekends, and after an exhausting day, the night sky falls quick and there are many locations to see the northern lights! This is a very cool aspect of the North Pole and many people enjoy these events </p>
