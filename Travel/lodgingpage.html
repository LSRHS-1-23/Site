    <p>The North Pole has great areas to stay overnight when spending your vacation here! Since the North Pole is most popular during the winter when families come to visit Santa and his village, there are a lot of lodging options to accommedate for all of the visitors. One highly requested lodge happens to be right in Santa's workshop! The Elves are very respectful when they know people are living there and there is hardly any complaints about noise coming from building the toys. There are also six other lodgings two being on ski hills and the other four within the most active part of the village. The reviews have been four and a half stars on average for the lodging here in the North Pole, we hope you enjoy your stay!</p>
